Useful scripts
==============
A collection of scripts of varying utility.

``__linkup.py`` Run this to make links from ${HOME}/bin to all the scripts in
this directory.  The links omit the extension, which works well on Unices.
``-h`` for help.

``change_extension.py`` An old script which does what it says.  ``-h`` for
help.

``check_indent.py`` Reports on the indentation in a file. Not sure why I wrote
it.  No help. Read its docstring.

``editpath.py`` Edit a PATH string, and return the result.  ``-h`` for help.

``friday.py`` Give the date of a Friday.  ``-h`` for help.

``html2text.py`` Convert HTML to some-sort-of text. A very old script.  There
are much better versions of this around, which are also more robust, but they
don't quite produce the same results.  ``-h`` for help.

``mb.py`` This was written on VMS, where it was useful. Report on file sizes,
and/or convert bytes to/from megabytes.  ``-h`` for help.

``natgrid.py`` Once upon a time I did work with OS(GB) maps. This script
converts to/from National Grid references.  No help. Read its docstring.

``onpath.py`` Sort of a home-grown version of 'which', but with regular
expressions.  No help. Read its docstring.

``remove_links.py`` Remove links in a directory. Not sure why I wanted this.
No help - just runs. Which is nasty of it.

``remove_twiddle_files.py`` Find and delete files ending with "~", and other
files of the sort that get left lying around.  ``-h`` for help.

``rundoctest.py`` A simple script to run doctest.py over a file.  ``-h`` for
help.

``setup_muddle.py`` I source this in my '.bashrc' file to set up my usage of
muddle. So it may be of no interest to anyone else.

``showpath.py`` Show the PATH, or the PYTHONPATH, or various other paths, in a
useful manner, reporting on duplicates. Works on Windows as well.  ``-h`` for
help.  

``tidypath.py`` Return a new string representing a PATH without duplicates.
``-h`` for help.
